# Sample PDF Files

This directory contains sample PDF files for testing the PDF outline extractor.

## Files:
- `sample1.pdf` - A sample academic paper with numbered headings
- `sample2.pdf` - A sample technical report with uppercase headings

## Note:
These are placeholder files. In a real deployment, you would place actual PDF files here for processing.

## Usage:
The Docker container will process all PDF files in this directory and generate corresponding JSON files in the `../output/` directory.
